# Tool Overview and Architecture

## Description

<!-- {{text({prompt: "Write a 1-2 sentence overview of this chapter. Include the tool's purpose, the problem it solves, and its primary use cases."})}} -->

This chapter introduces sdd-forge, a CLI tool that automates documentation generation from source code analysis and enforces a Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow. It describes the tool's purpose—eliminating documentation drift and ungoverned AI implementation—along with its internal architecture and primary use cases for teams working with AI coding agents.

### Purpose

<!-- {{text({prompt: "Describe the problem this CLI tool solves and its target users. Derive the purpose from package.json and README."})}} -->

Engineering teams using AI coding agents face two persistent problems: documentation that drifts out of sync with evolving source code, and AI agents that implement features without validated specifications. sdd-forge addresses both by providing a pipeline that automatically regenerates structured documentation from live source analysis, and a three-phase SDD workflow that gates implementation behind programmatic spec validation. The tool targets software development teams—particularly those using Claude Code, Codex CLI, or similar AI agents—who need always-current documentation and a disciplined process for feature development.

The package is distributed as a Node.js CLI (`sdd-forge`) and requires no external npm dependencies, relying solely on Node.js built-in modules. It is configured per project via `.sdd-forge/config.json` and supports over 35 built-in presets covering technology stacks such as Node.js CLI tools, Next.js, Laravel, Hono, Drizzle ORM, Cloudflare Workers, and more.

### Key Concepts

<!-- {{text({prompt: "Explain the key concepts and terminology needed to understand this tool in table format. Extract the main concepts from source code."})}} -->

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Preset** | A named bundle of scan patterns, chapter templates, and DataSource classes (e.g., `node-cli`, `laravel`). Presets form a single-inheritance chain via the `parent` field in `preset.json`. |
| **Analysis** | A structured JSON snapshot (`.sdd-forge/output/analysis.json`) produced by `docs scan`, containing file metadata, classes, methods, imports, exports, and configuration values extracted from source code. |
| **DataSource** | A class that reads `analysis.json` and returns structured data for insertion into a documentation template via `{{data(...)}}` directives. |
| **Directive** | A special comment in a markdown template: `{{data(...)}}` for structured data tables and `{{text(...)}}` for AI-generated prose. Both are replaced in-place during the pipeline. |
| **Pipeline** | The ordered documentation generation sequence: `scan → enrich → init → data → text → readme → agents → [translate]`. Each stage is also executable individually. |
| **Flow** | A single SDD cycle with three phases—Plan, Implement, Finalize—whose state is persisted in `specs/<NNN>/flow.json`. |
| **Spec** | A specification document (`spec.md`) created in the Plan phase that defines requirements and acceptance criteria before any implementation begins. |
| **Guardrail** | A set of design principles defined in a preset's `guardrail.json` that a spec must satisfy, validated by `flow run gate` before implementation is allowed. |
| **Template** | A markdown file in a preset's `templates/` directory that structures a documentation chapter using directives and `{%block%}` inheritance markers. |
| **Template Inheritance** | The `{%extends%}` / `{%block%}` mechanism that allows child preset templates to override specific sections of a parent template without duplicating the entire file. |

### Typical Usage Flow

<!-- {{text({prompt: "Describe the typical steps from installation to first output in step format. Derive the steps from help output and command definitions in the source code."})}} -->

1. **Install the package globally** — Run `npm install -g sdd-forge` to make the `sdd-forge` command available in your terminal.

2. **Run the interactive setup wizard** — In your project root, run `sdd-forge setup`. The wizard prompts for your project's type (preset, e.g., `node-cli`), documentation output languages, default language, and AI agent provider. It writes `.sdd-forge/config.json` and creates the initial skill files.

3. **Scan source code** — Run `sdd-forge docs scan`. The scanner traverses source files defined by the preset's scan patterns and produces `.sdd-forge/output/analysis.json` with structured metadata.

4. **Enrich the analysis** — Run `sdd-forge docs enrich`. The AI agent adds summaries, chapter assignments, and role annotations to the entries in `analysis.json`.

5. **Initialize chapter templates** — Run `sdd-forge docs init`. The preset's template inheritance chain is resolved and chapter files are written to `docs/`.

6. **Populate structured data** — Run `sdd-forge docs data`. Each `{{data(...)}}` directive in `docs/*.md` is replaced with a generated table from the corresponding DataSource.

7. **Generate AI prose** — Run `sdd-forge docs text`. Each `{{text(...)}}` directive is replaced with AI-generated content based on the directive's prompt and the current analysis.

8. **Build README and agent context** — Run `sdd-forge docs readme` and `sdd-forge docs agents` to produce `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

9. **Run the full pipeline at once** — Use `sdd-forge docs build` as a shortcut to execute steps 3–8 in a single command.

### External Integrations

<!-- {{text({prompt: "If there are external system integrations, describe their purpose and connection method in table format."})}} -->

| System | Purpose | Connection Method |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude CLI** | AI prose generation for `{{text}}` directives, analysis enrichment, spec gate validation, and code review | Spawned as a subprocess by `src/lib/agent.js`; configured via `agent.providers.claude` in `config.json`; communicates via stdout/stderr |

| **Custom AI Providers** | Support for any AI agent accessible via a CLI command | Defined in `agent.providers` as a command template with argument placeholders; spawned as a subprocess by `agent.js` |
| **Git CLI** | Branch creation, worktree management, commit, merge, and push operations during SDD flow execution | Called directly via `git` CLI in `src/lib/git-helpers.js`; must be installed and available on PATH |
| **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** | Link flow specs to GitHub Issues and support pull request creation and management during finalization | Called via `src/lib/git-helpers.js`; requires `gh` installed, authenticated, and `commands.gh: "enable"` set in `config.json` |
<!-- {{/text}} -->
### Environment Differences

<!-- {{text({prompt: "Describe the configuration differences across environments (local/staging/production)."})}} -->

sdd-forge is a local developer CLI tool and does not have built-in environment tiers (local, staging, production). All configuration is stored in a single `.sdd-forge/config.json` file at the project root.

Differences across runtime contexts are managed through the following configuration fields:

| Field | Local Development | CI / Automated Pipelines |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.timeout` | Can be left at the default; interactive sessions tolerate longer waits | Recommended to set explicitly to prevent pipeline hangs |
| `agent.retryCount` | Lower values acceptable for interactive use | Higher values recommended for unattended runs |
| `concurrency` | Default (5) suits most workstations | May be increased on CI hosts with more CPU cores |
| `agent.profiles` | Named profiles can point to a developer's local AI provider | Profiles can be switched to a CI-appropriate provider command |
| `commands.gh` | Set to `"enable"` when `gh` is authenticated on the developer's machine | Set to `"enable"` only if the CI runner has `gh` authenticated with a token |
| `logs.enabled` | Optional; useful for debugging agent calls locally | Can be enabled to capture JSONL prompt logs for audit trails |

Documentation output files (`docs/`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) are generated artifacts committed to the repository and are not environment-specific. The SDD flow state in `specs/<NNN>/flow.json` is local to the developer's worktree and is not shared between environments.
